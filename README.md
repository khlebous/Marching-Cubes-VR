# Marching-Cubes-VR

Created application is used to create scenes 3D. Scenes consist of the terrain and objects placed on it. The application is dedicated to the Oculus Rift platform.

Marching cubes algorithm allows to create triangle grid using the data from uniformly distributed in space samples. Each of the samples contains information whether it is inside or outside the model. 

The application has four modes:
 - Main mode
 - Scene mode
 - Terrain mode
 - Model mode
 
In terrain and model modes user gives shape to the selected object. The working tool is a brush with variable color, size, shape and type of applied changes. The scene mode allows you to arrange created models on terrain; manipulation and edition already set objects.

The application was written within engineering thesis at the MiNI Faculty (WUT) in collaboration with [McThrok](https://github.com/McThrok).
